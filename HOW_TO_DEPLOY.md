# How to Deploy T1-T2 Mapper - Simple Guide

## Your File is Ready!

**`index.html`** - This is your complete application (3464 lines, 171KB)
- ✅ All CSS embedded
- ✅ All JavaScript embedded  
- ✅ No external files needed
- ✅ Works standalone

## Simplest Method: Copy & Paste

### Step 1: Open the HTML File
Open `index.html` in any text editor (VS Code, Notepad, TextEdit, etc.)

### Step 2: Copy Everything
- Select all (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A)
- Copy (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C)

### Step 3: Paste into Wiki
1. Go to your Wiki page
2. Click "Edit" 
3. Look for "HTML" or "Source" mode button
4. Paste the entire HTML content
5. Save

**That's it!** Your application should now be live in the Wiki.

## Alternative: GitHub Pages (No Setup Needed)

If Wiki doesn't work, use GitHub Pages:

1. Go to: https://github.com/vamsi676/t1-t2-mapper/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
3. Click "Save"
4. Wait 1-2 minutes
5. Your app will be live at: **https://vamsi676.github.io/t1-t2-mapper/**

Then share this URL or embed it in Wiki using an iframe.

## Testing Locally First

Before deploying, test it:

1. Double-click `index.html` (opens in browser)
2. Or right-click → "Open with" → Browser
3. Verify everything works
4. Then deploy

## Note About CDK/NPM Files

You can **ignore** these files - they're not needed:
- `package.json`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `cdk.json`
- `bin/` folder
- `lib/` folder

Just use `index.html` - that's all you need!
